# RISCV_SUPERSCALAR

This is an implementaion for the RISC-V Pipelined CPU.
That design was implemented by adding hardware and change some single port hardware to double port. 
In this way it was possible to increase the throughput of the system to 2 instructions per cycle.
It has a 5 stage pipeline without hazard handling.

The repository includes a video to demonstrate and explain the design.
